        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds beef we used some short ribs, ribeye, and filet</li>
            <li>1 white onion</li>
            <li>3 - 4 thin ginger slices</li>
            <li>7 whole garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 scallions white halves separated from green halves</li>
            <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>¼ cup mirin</li>
            <li>½ medium Asian pear grated</li>
            <li>½ clove garlic minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp grated ginger</li>
            <li>½ tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>10 oz daikon cut into large chunks about 1-1/2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>4 dried shiitake mushrooms soaked and quartered</li>
            <li>1 large carrot cut into large chunks about 1 inch long</li>
            <li>6 dried dates</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak your ribs in cold water for 6 hours. This will drain any remaining blood out of them. Drain out the water and pat dry.</li>
            <li>Over a roaring cooking fire, boil 5 cups of water and put in the ginger, garlic, white parts of the scallions (save the green parts), and half the onion. Add the meat and bring to a boil uncovered. Reduce your cooking fire or stove to medium-high for 10 minutes. Pull the meat out from the liquid.</li>
            <li>Remove the vegetables from the stock using a strainer or colander, then put the stock into a fridge to help the fat solidify (this isn't entirely necessary if you don't mind fatty broth).</li>
            <li>Put the beef and all the braising ingredients into the pot and stir for a few minutes. While its sizzling, skim off any accumulated fat from the stock in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Add half the stock to the pot. Cover and boil with your cooking fire on medium heat for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While it's boiling, chop up your vegetables, along with the remaining half of the onion. After the 30 minutes, throw in the vegetables and boil covered for another 20.</li>
            <li>Throw in the dates and the green parts of the scallions, and stir uncovered for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drizzle with some sesame oil and sesame seeds and serve to some hungry adventurers!</li>
        </ol>
