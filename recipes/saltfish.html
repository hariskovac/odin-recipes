        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sailor's rift saltfish is a delicious salty cured fish snack that goes well plain or with a variety of sauces.</p>
        <p>This dish is filled with protein to get you through the most arduous sea voyages. Don't set sail without scarfing down this tasty treat!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp ground pepper</li>
            <li>3 tbsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>9 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>7 ½ tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>28 oz hamachi filet or other quality white fish filet, the curing process will generally make raw fish food-safe, but go with sashimi-grade fish just in case</li>
            <li>1 ½ cup shelled edamame</li>
            <li>1 ½ tbsp salt</li>
            <li>1 ½ tsp sugar</li>
            <li>3 tsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>9.5 oz Inglehoffer cream style horseradish sauce or other creamy horseradish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp japanese mustard</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>8 tbsp japanese rice seasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the fish seasonings together and thoroughly coat the fish filets. Wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for 3 hours. Meanwhile, work on making the dressing but once the fish are done scrape off the excess seasoning.</li>
            <li>Heat up the edamame. Set aside a handful for garnish then dump the rest into a blender along with all the dressing ingredients besides the rice seasoning. Blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Slice the fish into roughly 1/4 inch thick slices, and serve on top of a dollop of the dressing with some edamame and rice seasoning garnished on top. Or for a particularly rowdy bunch of sailors, have them dip into individual dipping bowls of dressing and avoid all the fanciness. These folks have adventuring to get back to.</li>
